This repository demonstrates a common error in ActionScript 3: Null Pointer Exceptions.  The `bug.as` file contains code that throws a null pointer exception. The `bugSolution.as` file provides a corrected version.  The error arises from attempting to access a property of an object after the object reference has been set to null.  This is a frequent issue when working with objects and conditional logic in ActionScript 3. The solution involves carefully checking for null before accessing object properties.
